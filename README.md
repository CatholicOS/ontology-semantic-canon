# Catholic Semantic Canon

This repository contains a formal ontology designed to model the hierarchical and relational structure of the Catholic **Deposit of Faith**.
It maps the interdependence of Sacred Scripture, Sacred Tradition, and the Magisterium, providing a semantic framework for how these sources are transmitted and interpreted.

### 📖 Overview

The **Catholic Semantic Canon** moves beyond a static bibliography.
It provides a machine-readable logic for the "Living Tradition", capturing not just what the sources are,
but how they relate to one another in terms of authority, chronology, and theological weight.

### 🛠 Core Objectives

- **Hierarchical Mapping**: Defining the relationship between primary revelation and secondary authoritative commentary.
- **Interdependence**: Modeling how the Church’s Magisterium interprets Scripture and how Tradition sustains both.
- **Contextual Use**: Tracking the development of doctrine and the application of sources within liturgical and canonical contexts.
- **Semantic Interoperability**: Enabling theological data to be queried using standardized formats (such as OWL or RDF).

### 🗂 Key Components

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Sacred Scripture** | The written Word of God, categorized by canon, genre, and testament. |
| **Sacred Tradition** | The oral and lived transmission of faith, including Patristics and Liturgy. |
| **The Magisterium** | The teaching authority (Papal Encyclicals, Conciliar Documents) and their levels of certainty. |
| **Relational Logic** | Predicates that define "Interpretation," "Clarification," and "Succession." |
