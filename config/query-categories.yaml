# Query Categories Configuration
# Maps query categories to their root class URIs in the ontology
#
# These mappings enable semantic queries using rdfs:subClassOf* property paths
# instead of fragile regex patterns. When a class is added as a subclass of
# any root class, queries automatically include it.

#
# - authority_properties: Authority-related object properties
#   (These are properties, not classes - different query pattern needed)
