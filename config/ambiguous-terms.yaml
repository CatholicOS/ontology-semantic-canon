# Ambiguous Terms Configuration
#
# Terms that may have multiple meanings in the Catholic ontology context.
# These terms require disambiguation to understand their semantic meaning.
#
# Examples:
#   - "Brother" can mean a religious brother (monk) or a sibling relationship
#   - "Canon" can mean a church law or a member of a cathedral chapter
#   - "Mass" can mean the Eucharistic celebration or a gathering
#
# To find new ambiguous terms, run:
#   python scripts/find_ambiguous_terms.py
#
# After updating this list, also update:
#   - queries/jena/07-disambiguation.rq (FILTER clause - uses term strings)
#   - queries/rdflib/07-disambiguation.rq (VALUES clause - uses class URIs)
#
# Note: The Jena query uses term strings while the rdflib query requires
# specific class URIs. Use find_ambiguous_terms.py to identify URIs.
# Future enhancement: extend pattern_generator.py to auto-generate query
# fragments from this config.
